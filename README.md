# Breast-Cancer-prediction
Breast Cancer Prediction Model

This repository hosts a machine learning project aimed at predicting breast cancer diagnoses using patient data. The project utilizes advanced algorithms to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on key features, assisting in early diagnosis and supporting healthcare decisions.

Key Features
Dataset: The project uses a labeled dataset containing features such as tumor size, shape, and cell nuclei texture.
Data Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection for improved model accuracy.
Machine Learning Models: Implementation of multiple classification techniques, including:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Neural Networks
Evaluation Metrics: Performance assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curves.
Visualization: Provides insights into feature importance and classification results through plots and charts.
Tools and Libraries
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Manipulation: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: scikit-learn
